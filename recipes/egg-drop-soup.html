    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> This chicken egg drop soup is born from a love of the soup, many trips to my favorite Chinese restaurant, and many questions. 
        This variation is the result. Simplicity is the key. 
        The soup can be reheated or frozen and reheated.

        <li> 1 ½ tablespoons cornstarch </li>
        <li> 2 eggs </li>
